# KBRD
An open-source Teensy-based custom computer keyboard project.

#**IMPORTANT**
This project is still in early development and __neither hard- nor software are finalized__. Use with caution!

## Components
The KBRD project entails both open-source hard- and software to build a computer keyboard using PJRC's Teensy (https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/) as its brain.

### Hardware
The PCB design files and a bill of materials.

### Software
The firmware running on the Teensy, written in C++, as well as the 'driver' running on the host machine, which is written in Python.
